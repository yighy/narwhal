# Changelog

All notable changes to Orgwhal (named Narwhal up to 0.16.0). Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- The icon's drawing sits a little higher, so it looks centered

## [0.17.0] - 2026-10-11

### Changed
- Narwhal is now Orgwhal, with the application ID `io.github.yighy.orgwhal`: it installs as a
  new app, beside Narwhal (pick the notes folder again, then uninstall Narwhal), signed with a
  new key of its own

## [0.16.0] - 2026-10-11

### Changed
- Icon: the narwhal's head, now flat underneath, over a dot and a bar in white (a list's line)
  instead of the wave; its eyes are cut out in the background's green
- Reminder notifications show the note's parent next to the time; opened, they show the whole
  path (notebook › parents) and the start of the note's content as plain text: lists with
  bullets, checkboxes as ☐ / ☑, a table's rows with their fields side by side

## [0.15.0] - 2026-10-11

### Changed
- The `id:` suggestions also find notes by their notebook's and parents' titles: "Meals" offers
  the note Meals, then the notes under it, and "meals rice" finds Rice under Meals

## [0.14.0] - 2026-10-11

### Changed
- New icon: the narwhal's head over a wave, its striped tusk up; the themed and notification icons
  follow it
- In the tree view, a note opens out of its box and closes back into it, as from a notebook's
  list

## [0.13.1] - 2026-10-11

### Fixed
- Leaving a new note that has content, tags or dates but no title now warns first: a new note is
  saved once it has a title, so what was written would be lost; "Add a title" goes back to it

## [0.13.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Archive a note (its ⋮ menu, or the selection's): it goes with its sub-notes to the end of the
  notebook's archive file (gtd.org_archive, next to it), with the properties Emacs adds
  (ARCHIVE_TIME, ARCHIVE_FILE, ARCHIVE_OLPATH, ARCHIVE_CATEGORY, ARCHIVE_TODO); the message
  offers to undo it
- Links in properties (:FATHER: [[id:…][Paul]]) show as links on the note screen and open with a
  tap; a tap beside them edits the value

### Changed
- Folded notes stay folded when the app is closed; a notebook shown for the first time folds as
  Org would show it, after its #+STARTUP (overview, show2levels…) and its notes' VISIBILITY
- The guide notebook also explains the tree view and archiving, with a note to archive

### Fixed
- A copied note, pasted, no longer keeps the ID of the note it was copied from (with two notes
  of one ID, id: links could lead to either); cut notes keep it where they are first pasted

## [0.12.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Tree view of a notebook (its ⋮ menu): the notes drawn as boxes from left to right, moved and
  zoomed with the fingers; a tap opens a note, the round button at its side folds its sub-notes
  and shows how many are hidden, and the view moves to show the ones unfolded; a button shows the
  whole tree
- In the tree view, a long press selects notes, with the same bars as in the notebook: notes
  can be moved up, down, a level up or down, or to another notebook, and slide to their new places
- In the tree view, a double tap between the boxes zooms in around it, then back to the whole
  tree; the tree is shown again as it was left (zoom, place, folded notes), also after the app
  is closed

## [0.11.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- A guide notebook (in English) explaining Narwhal with examples to try: offered once the
  folder is first chosen, and in Settings, About; its example dates are set around the day it
  is added, without times, so it rings no reminders

### Changed
- Once a shared note is moved elsewhere, the Inbox notebook is deleted if nothing is left in it
  (not even a title line); the next share makes it again
- Libraries updated: Material 3 1.5.0-beta01 (out of alpha), Activity 1.13.0, Core 1.19.1,
  coroutines 1.11.0

### Fixed
- A list item whose text goes on to the next line no longer gets a fold chevron; only items with
  sub-items fold
- Folding and unfolding (all notes, or one with many sub-notes) moves the notes below once,
  instead of a second time a moment later
- The buttons behind a swiped note stay in the part of it on screen, also on a note with a long
  content and while scrolling
- An address written as verbatim or code (=file:=, ~https://…~) shows as such, not as a broken link

## [0.10.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Statistics cookies, [/] and [%], kept up to date as in Emacs: in a list item they count its
  sub-items' checkboxes, in a title the note's checkboxes or else its sub-notes done; a parent
  checkbox shows [-] or [X] with its sub-items; cookies show as small pills
- Table formulas (#+TBLFM): a "Recalculate" button under the table computes the common ones as
  Emacs does (column and field formulas, references and ranges, + - * / ^, vsum, vmean, vmin,
  vmax, vcount, formats such as %.2f) and realigns the table; others are left as they are
- Columns of numbers align right in tables
- Tables and blocks named with #+NAME show their name; links without a scheme lead within the
  notes as in Org: [[name]] (a <<target>>, a named element, or a title), [[*Title]], [[#custom-id]]
- remote(name, ref) in table formulas reads a field or range of another table, named with #+NAME
  or by the ID of its note

### Changed
- Text shared from other apps always goes to the Inbox notebook; on the new note, a tap on the
  notebook at the top moves it elsewhere (the setting is gone)

### Fixed
- A note moved to another notebook from its screen stays shown at its new place

## [0.9.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added
- Text shared from other apps (a page, a selection) becomes a note in an "Inbox" notebook, or
  in the notebook chosen in the settings
- Deleting notes no longer asks first: the message offers to undo it; delete comes first in
  the swipe actions
- Move notes to any notebook, under the note of your choice, from the selection or from a note's
  menu
- Agenda: filters by notebook and by tag; swipe left to put a time off by a day, a week, or to
  a date; notes of the same time are sorted by priority
- Tables, source and example blocks, quotes and centered text show as such; drawers fold to
  their name and open with a tap (the :LOGBOOK: shows as the clock's time)
- List items with sub-items fold and unfold with a chevron at the end of their line
- "Now" button in the date dialog of the keyboard toolbar: inserts the current time, inactive
- Clocking: start and stop a clock on a note, with the time spent; it is written to the note's
  :LOGBOOK: as in Emacs, and a running clock shows in the lists

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added
- Property names and values already in use are suggested while typing a property
- Swiping a note left also offers to delete it

### Changed
- The keyboard toolbar and the `id:` and `file:` suggestions go as soon as the keyboard starts
  to close, instead of following it down

## [0.7.1] - 2026-10-08

### Changed
- Notebook initials and icons sit in a plain circle, of the same color for all notebooks

### Fixed
- In a done note's title, links are grayed out like the rest

## [0.7.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added
- Setting to strike through done notes or not

### Fixed
- In a done note's title, links and underlined text are struck through too

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added
- French translation, and a "Use English language" setting that ignores the phone's language
  (on Android 13+, the app's language can also be chosen in the system settings)
- Moved notes slide to their new place in the outline, and the list scrolls to keep them in view

## [0.5.3] - 2026-10-07

### Changed
- New icon: a round narwhal head with its tusk, without the sea; the themed icon has the same drawing
- Swiping a note left shows plain icons, as swiping right does

### Fixed
- A save can no longer leave the end of a longer previous version at the end of the file; each
  file is read back after it is written

## [0.5.2] - 2026-10-07

### Changed
- No property is hidden by default: the ID shows on the note screen unless added to the hidden
  properties

## [0.5.1] - 2026-10-07

### Changed
- Themed icon (Android 13+): the narwhal is centered

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added
- Hidden properties setting: the properties not shown on the note screen (the ID by default),
  in place of the switch for the ID

### Changed
- New notes no longer get an ID by default: linking to a note gives it one
- New icon: the narwhal rises from the sea with its tail, its tusk on its head

### Fixed
- The list no longer jumps when a note or a notebook gets selected
- The keyboard toolbar goes away with the keyboard
- On a new note, going from the title to the content keeps the keyboard up

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added
- Formatting buttons in the keyboard toolbar: bold, italic, underline, strike-through, code
- The toolbar's date button opens the full date dialog (time, end time, repeater), and changes
  the date at the cursor when there is one
- Snooze length setting for the reminder notification's button
- About section in the settings: version, source code, license, credits
- Space between notes setting for the notebook outline: comfortable, compact or dense
- Setting to show the ID property on the note screen

### Changed
- Undo and redo stay in view at the end of the keyboard toolbar
- The drawer shows the app name without the icon
- The ID property is hidden on the note screen by default
- New notes get an ID by default, so they can be linked to right away
- Notebooks show each note's content under its title by default
- Folding and unfolding notes takes half the time, the notes coming one after the other

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added
- New name and icon: the app is now Narwhal (application ID `io.github.yighy.narwhal`), with a
  narwhal launcher icon, themed icon and notification icon, also shown on the welcome screen and
  in the drawer
- Multiple selection in notebooks, as in Orgzly: move, cut, copy, paste, delete, set state,
  scheduled and deadline times; select and delete or rename notebooks
- Note screen: edit tags, state and priority in place; notebook icons; share a note;
  a menu to add notes above, under or below the current one
- Orgzly search syntax, plus `ad.N` (agenda view), `e.` (events), `cr.` (creation date) and the
  `o.e` / `o.cr` sort orders; saved searches with their own screen (select, delete, reorder)
- End times for scheduled and deadline times; repeater symbols (`+`, `++`, `.+`)
- Org links of any kind (`http`, `mailto`, `tel`, `geo`, `file:`…) open as in Orgzly;
  `file:` suggestions from the notes folder; backlinks to the current note
- When a note is renamed, links showing its old title can be updated (ask, always or never)
- Checkboxes that can be ticked; Org markup (bold, italic, code…) rendered
- Typing help: list and checkbox continuation, bracket pairs, and a toolbar over the keyboard
  (list, checkbox, indent, link, date, undo, redo)
- Live reload: files changed by another app are picked up while Narwhal is open
- Reminders: snooze (in 1 hour, tomorrow) from the notification, optional alarm clock alarms
- Option to add a `CREATED` property to new notes
- Theme setting (system, light, dark) and dynamic color
- Signed release builds

### Changed
- Shared element transitions between screens; a swipe cuts a transition short, and each screen
  keeps its scroll position
- Titles, content and the notebook preface save without buttons; back saves the note
- New notes open in the full note screen instead of a dialog
- Joda-Time removed, for a smaller app

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added
- Agenda: overdue tasks, today and the next 6 days, with repeating tasks

  and `id:` links to other notes
